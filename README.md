# Keep My Monitors Awake

Keep My Monitors Awake is a simple browser extension for Chromium browser based (Google Chrome, Brave...) that prevents your monitors from going to sleep. 

If you've ever been frustrated by your monitors going to sleep in the middle of a project or while you're listening to music, Keep My Monitors Awake is the solution you've been looking for. By sending an inaudible audio signal to your monitors, this extension keeps them awake and prevents them from going to sleep, so you can keep working or listening without interruption. 


## How it works

Keep My Monitors Awake uses a simple but effective method to prevent your monitors from going to sleep. The extension periodically sends an inaudible audio signal to your monitors, which keeps them awake.

## Installation

You can install the extension by following these steps:

1. Download this repository and unzip it.
2. Open Google Chrome or Brave.
3. Go to: **[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)** (for Google Chrome users) or **[brave://extensions/](brave://extensions/)** (for Brave users)
4. Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
5. Select the folder **keep-my-monitors-awake** you unzipped at first step. 

Make sure the extension is running by checking the ON/OFF button.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, it works automatically in the background. You don't need to do anything else.

## Compatible Monitors

Keep My Monitors Awake works with a variety of monitors, including:

- KRK Rokit G3 (RP5, RP7, RP8, RP10)
- KRK Rokit G4 (RP5, RP7, RP8, RP10)
- Focal Alpha (50, 65, 80)
- ...

Actually, I think the extension works for any monitor.
