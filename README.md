# Keep My Monitors Awake

**Keep My Monitors Awake** is a simple browser extension for Chromium browsers based (Google Chrome, Brave...), and Firefox browser that prevents your monitors from going to sleep. 

If you've ever been frustrated by your monitors going to sleep in the middle of a project or while you're listening to music, Keep My Monitors Awake is the solution you've been looking for.

## How it works

Keep My Monitors Awake uses a simple but effective method to prevent your monitors from going to sleep. The extension periodically sends an inaudible audio signal to your monitors, which keeps them awake.

## Installation

You can install the extension by following these steps:

1. Download this repository and unzip it.
2. Open your browser (Chromium based or Firefox).
3. Go to: **[chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)** (for Chromium users) or **[brave://extensions/](brave://extensions/)** (for Brave users) or **[about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)** (for Firefox users)
4. (Only for Chromium based browsers) Turn ON the **"Developer mode"** (the right-top button).
4. Click the **"Load unpacked"** (Chromium) or **"Load Temporary Add-on"** button (Firefox).
5. Select the folder **keep-my-monitors-awake** you unzipped at first step (Chromium), or the manifest.json file (Firefox). 

Make sure the extension is running by checking the ON/OFF button.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, it works automatically in the background. You don't need to do anything else.

## Enable / Disable the extension

You can enable / disable the extension by simply clicking on the extension icon in the top taskbar (if pinned). When the extension is enabled, the icon is in black. When the extension is disabled, the icon is in grey.

By enabling or disabling the extension, you can easily control whether the audio signals are being sent to your monitors or not. This can be useful if you need silence for a certain period of time or if you want to save energy by disabling the extension for a while.

## Compatible Monitors

Keep My Monitors Awake works with a variety of monitors, including:

- KRK Rokit G3 (RP5, RP7, RP8, RP10)
- KRK Rokit G4 (RP5, RP7, RP8, RP10)
- Focal Alpha (50, 65, 80)
- ...

Actually, I think the extension works for any monitor.
